Extremly basic explanation of the images in this folder.


1. Select "Giants Engine 9 ..." template
   By checking the "Use UV Tile workflow" we can make use of the color mask option in shader.

2. "NameOfTexture" will be the name which our exported files will get.
   To change name dubble click on the text.

3. Check "Your assest" to view the assests included.
   GE - Dirt - Shadermask = Only Dirt layer
   GE - Wear - Shadermask = Only Wear layer
   GE - Steel Painted     = Dirt, Wear and base color

4. Not much to explain about it.
   Dirt and Wear amount is shown when "Show X" is checked.
   Color Mask is only usefull if UDIM's are used, using it will override to Base color channel with these colors.
